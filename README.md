## About

Ramunas Girdziusas, aabbtree77 at gmail.com

[CV (React show-off)](https://aabbtree77.github.io/cv/), [resume.pdf](https://aabbtree77.github.io/pdfs/RamunasGirdziusasResume.pdf), [cv.pdf](https://aabbtree77.github.io/pdfs/RamunasGirdziusasCV.pdf)

I studied electrical engineering in Lithuania from 1994 to 1999, researched machine learning in Finland from 2000 to 2008, completed three postdoc projects, and returned in 2014. Living off my savings, considering a career in [software engineering](https://1x.engineer/). Take a look at some of my work.

## Self-Funded Mostly: 2014 - 2025

### [surveillance](https://github.com/aabbtree77/surveillance)

A setup for an IP camera with Motion to store videos on Ubuntu 22.04 with motion detected in them. LAN-based tests, would need AnyDesk, RustDesk, or [anywherelan/awl](https://github.com/anywherelan/awl) (P2P) for remote surveillance.

### auth-starter-backend + frontend

A tiny demo [backend](https://github.com/aabbtree77/auth-starter-backend) and [frontend](https://github.com/aabbtree77/auth-starter-frontend) for a 3rd party-free username/password authentication. It includes a memo how to set up browser cookies locally and with the HTTPS.

### [lawtrust.eu](https://lawtrust.eu/)

A multilingual website for a lawyer who speaks nine languages. Tailwind CSS, [gomarkdown](https://github.com/gomarkdown/markdown), porkbun.com, and github pages. This project was an eye opener about the SEO and online visibility.

### [miniguestlog](https://github.com/aabbtree77/miniguestlog)

A MERN app to [record](https://aabbtree77.github.io/miniguestlog/loadGuestsSpinner.html) geolocation of the last 50 visitors of aabbtree77.github.io. MongoDB Atlas, Compass, render.com, github pages, ipify.org, and geoip-lite API for the GeoLite data from MaxMind.

### [adast](https://github.com/aabbtree77/adast)

A joint work with Saulius Rakauskas (Infovega). We have been maintaining a *real* factory machine since February 2020 (last update: February 2024). I wrote microcontroller code in C (avr-gcc).

### [esp32-vpn](https://github.com/aabbtree77/esp32-vpn)

A joint work with Saulius Rakauskas (Infovega): A remote plant watering system with ESP32, MicroPython, Mosquitto MQTT, Ubuntu and [awl](https://github.com/anywherelan/awl) with golibp2p. Numerous tests of [hole punching](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hole_punching_(networking)>) through layers of routers with the use of the P2P network other than torrents, to control an ESP32 device globally, without obscure 3rd party services.

### [twinpeekz](https://github.com/aabbtree77/twinpeekz)

Volumetric lighting in [Go](https://github.com/aabbtree77/twinpeekz) and [Nim](https://github.com/aabbtree77/twinpeekz2) (forward rendering, shadow mapping, PBR, 3D ray marching, OpenGL) following [Balázs Tóth, Tamás Umenhoffer (2009)](https://diglib.eg.org/handle/10.2312/egs.20091048.057-060), and [Tomas Öhberg (2017)](https://gitlab.com/tomasoh/100_procent_more_volume). The code is a complete rendering pipeline which may serve someone who wants to start building a 3D project while being lost at downscaling any existing ones.

### [tensors](https://aabbtree77.github.io/tensors/)

Verified tensor algebras of Donn G. Shankland (1970). [Après la montagne, il y a la montagne...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18rZv8qWZqA)

### [MNIST-0.17](https://github.com/aabbtree77/MNIST-0.17)

Confirmed Jonas Matuzas' CNN model. It closes the MNIST digit recognition saga. 

## PostDoc: 2008 - 2014

### [3D Shape Normalization](https://diglib.eg.org/handle/10.2312/3dor.20141044.009-015)

PostDoc Chronicles 3: Lugano, 2013-2014. The second encounter with quadratically-constrained quadratic cost optimization where I have mapped the "Swiss Roll" problem to the fast multipole method-based electrostatics with an approximate distance
constraint handling (simple projections ala Karmarkar and Cimmino in linear algebra). Davide Boscaini implemented the constraint gradient exactly and pushed the error rates.

### [Cloud Computing](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00723427)

PostDoc Chronicles 2: Saint-Étienne, 2012-2013. Optimization of the fluid flow which was implemented before me with OpenFOAM, CATIA, STAR CCM+ and ParaView, running on the ProActive PACA Grid cloud (INRIA) via the Scilab-to-Java bridge managed by Fabien Viale. The optimization involved kriging and CMA-ES as the meta-optimizer of the expected multi-point improvement whose MC integration I sped up with a specialized unscented transform. See the [slides](https://github.com/aabbtree77/aabbtree77.github.io/blob/main/pdfs/optimization2012.pdf). David Ginsbourger approached the integral differently, reducing it to Fortran routines which needed to compute multivariate Gaussian quadratures. 

### [Modified Thomson Problem (Unpublished, 2008 - 2009)](https://github.com/aabbtree77/aabbtree77.github.io/blob/main/pdfs/ucla2009.pdf)

PostDoc Chronicles 1: Los Angeles, 2008-2009. The modified Thomson problem is a quadratically-constrained quadratic cost optimization. I performed linearization and spectral analysis leading to a few definite statements. They did not become a larger research program.

## MSc followed by DSc (PhD): 2000 - 2008

### [Anisotropic Diffusion Filters, 2002 - 2008](https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/2999)

My DSc (PhD) thesis, Espoo 2002-2008. Added a layer of model selection to discontinuity-preserving filtering. Guided by Dr. Jorma Laaksonen and Prof. Erkki Oja.

Daffertshofer-Haken-1994 as a strategically wrong, but inspiring paper, E.T. Jaynes, machine learning in 2000s, my great nine years in Finland: Suomenlinna, Serena... Vaida Rutkauskaitė, Alexander Ilin, Vitaliy Nevdacha, Mykola Ivanchenko, Elia Liitiäinen, Jan-Hendrik Schleimer, Jarrod Creado, Leo Michael, Jaakko Martti Johannes Miettinen, Ville Rantamaula, Dexter He, Mikko Katajamaa, Petteri Räisänen, Jaakko Peltonen, Petri Hyötylä, Matthieu Molinier, Jagdeesh Rajani, Sandro Grech, Ivan Ore, Giedrius Zavadskis, Anita Bisi, Sergej Doudorov, Maxim Govtva, Paola Huaynate... I remember you.

### UNIPEN Parser, 2000

My first job, at the CIS Lab, [Helsinki University of Technology (TKK)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsinki_University_of_Technology), guided by Dr. Jorma Laaksonen. During the first two weeks I wrote a parser which loaded UNIPEN to Matlab.
